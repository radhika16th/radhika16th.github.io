                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I'm a student at McMaster University, studying Engineering,
                    and I will be majoring in Software, and pursuing my dream of becoming a software engineer. <br><br>
                    As an INFJ-T, I'm a thoughtful and creative problem solver, always eager to explore new ideas 
                    and find meaningful solutions. I love immersing myself in complex challenges and leveraging my 
                    intuition and analytical skills to overcome them.<br><br>
                    When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy exploring new reading, drawing, and playing video games.
                    I also love spending time with friends and capturing moments with my camera. Feel free to explore
                    and get to know more about me and my work!
                </p>
